# cmput304_code

Implementations of some algorithms from the lectures. Some test data in the form of plain-text files is available to test each implementation.

For example, with the "longest common subsequence" implementation you can test it using:
  python3 lcs.py < sample1.txt

Some implementations are in C++11 and can be compiled, say, with:
  g++ codefile.cpp -std=c++11 -o <executablename>
where you get to specify the executable name.
